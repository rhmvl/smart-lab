## Walkthrough

SmartLab currently consists of **three core features**, each designed to explore how technology and computation can assist in understanding and solving everyday problems.

### 1. Algo Works

A space to **visualize and interact with algorithms**.
Users can explore how sorting, searching, and other computational processes work through animated and interactive graphics — making abstract logic more tangible and fun to learn.

### 2. Calc Forge

A modern **scientific calculator** built for experimentation.
It allows you to perform precise and advanced mathematical calculations, providing a solid foundation for scientific exploration and daily computation.

### 3. AR Lab (Under development)

An **augmented reality (AR)** feature that uses your device’s **camera** to interact with the real world.
Currently under construction, AR Lab aims to **measure, calculate, and analyze** through visual recognition — turning your camera into a powerful educational tool.
